# Apache Cassandra Reserved & Non-reserved Keywords

Reserved keywords cannot be used as identifier, they are truly reserved for the language (but one can enclose a reserved keyword 
by double-quotes to use it as an identifier).

Non-reserved keywords however only have a specific meaning in certain context but can used as identifer otherwise. The only 
raison d'Ãªtre of these non-reserved keywords is convenience: some keyword are non-reserved when it was always easy for the 
parser to decide whether they were used as keywords or not.
