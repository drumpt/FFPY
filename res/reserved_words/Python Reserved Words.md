- A
  - and	
  - assert	
- B
  - break	
- C
  - class	
  - continue
- D 
  - def	
  - del	
- E 
  - elif	
  - else	
  - except
  - exec

  - finally	
  - for	
  - from	
- G 
  - global

  - or	
- P 
  - pass	
  - print	
- R 
  - raise
  - return

  - close	
  - float	
  - int

- A
  - acos	
  - asin	
  - atan	
- C 
  - cos	
- E 
  - e
  - exp	
- F
