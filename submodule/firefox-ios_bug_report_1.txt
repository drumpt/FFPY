Steps to reproduce:

1. create a folder in the bookmarks-toolbar and fill it with some bookmarks (one is enough)
2. opening the folder per mouse-leftclick works flawlessly but per touch-click it just opens for a fraction of a second and is immediately collapsed again
 
(Tested with installed ubuntu 14.04 and untouched live version on t440s with touchscreen)


Actual results:

Bookmarks-folders is immediateky closed again if opened per touchscreen


Expected results:

It should just open the folder and show the contents
